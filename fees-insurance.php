			<h2>Understanding Medical Insurance Payments</h2>
<p>There is a cost to medical care yet it shouldn’t interfere with getting care.</p>
<p>In today’s world, there really is no reason to not have insurance.</p>
<p>Yet you must realize that no matter what insurance you have, they expect you to pay each time you visit the Doctor. This is called the patient’s&nbsp;“Co-Pay” and it is expected to be given at the time of service.</p>
<p>Next issue is that Insurance Companies frequently send the&nbsp;Doctors&nbsp;payment for service to the patient’s home address expecting that the patient will give it to their Doctor before the next visit. Patients may cash that Insurance payment for Doctor services. This is a problem because, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the patient is ultimately responsible for their Co-Pay, and for the Doctors payment.</span> If they don’t turn over the checks to the Doctor their debt will increase, almost unnoticeably. One way to get around this problem is to pay cash for each Doctor’s visit and have us help you to send in your own bill so that you can keep the Doctors payment when the Insurance pays.</p>
<p>Billing is the responsibility of the patient and is provided by the Doctor’s clinic as a service to the patient. In the old days all patients paid cash and did their own billing and collections.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, the law doesn’t allow Doctor’s to write off more than 10% to 15% of a patient’s bill. Their intent is to discourage you from seeking medical care by forcing the patient to have&nbsp;“skin in the game”.</p>
<p>Bottom line; we at MD Health Clinics are willing to consider every payment plan. Helping you with your pain or addiction is our vocation, our calling, so we do our best to keep costs below what is normally charged in the local area. Medicare is noted for being one of the insurances that pay the least for medical services. We set our billing based on Medicare fee’s. We are not just “talking the talk”, we “walk the walk”.</p>
<h2>Insurance</h2>
<p>MD Health Clinics insurance staff is available to answer your questions.</p>
<p>We accept the majority of Health Care Insurances to include Medicare, Medicaid, Medical, CalOptima, Tricare Veterans Choice, and most MPN’s.</p>
