			<p>MD Health Clinics is located in the heart of Orange County, CA. Our multidisciplinary medical team offers a plan of care designed for each individual patient. With a diverse group of healthcare professionals working together to provide multimodal therapies, such as Interventionalist Injections, Medications, Pain Management, Addiction Medicine, Psychiatry, Psychology, Behavioral Modification, Counseling, Groups, Physical Therapy, Myofascial Release, Deep Tissue Massage, Pharmacists, and Social Services.</p>
<p>Think of it; Every scientifically proven treatment, provided by experienced medical specialists, working as a team, together, for your benefit.</p>
<p>We provide you with a comprehensive assessment compiled from our doctors’ in consultation with one another in our weekly meetings. The team approach promotes coordination and communication to promote integration of our individual expertise. We offer the patient a one stop effort as opposed to many separate evaluations, interpretations and plans. Our care is not fractionated. We are unique and uncommon by, ironically, providing you with what is expected as the Standard of care.</p>
<p>YES, even though others don’t do it, our Multidisciplinary Approach is THE STANDARD OF CARE. The United States Department of Health And Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Medical Association, every Evidence Based Article, and every Literature Review over the last 30 years, all have stated that anyone treating Pain should do so with an Integrated Multimodal Multidisciplinary Approach. The California Division of Workers Compensation has made this approach a law since 2004; Calif. Code of Regulations 9792.2-.27</p>
<p>Each treating discipline has its documented level of success; Behavioral Medicine helps 30% of the time, Injections with Medications helps 20% to 30% of the time, and Myofascial Release Therapy helps 20% of the time. This is why all authorities demand a multidisciplinary approach that, at least, includes these three basic disciplines. Their care cannot be fractionate but, instead, integrated with regular meetings to tailor their combined care for the patient. Opiates may still have a need but now the patient is empowered to control their own health problems without having to depend solely on addictive substance with all their dangers.</p>
<p>Patients may still use narcotics but become empowered with the tools that allow them to control their pain, instead of it controlling them, without having to worry about going through narcotic withdrawal.</p>
<p>We know that our approach is the way you should be treated. Although we do “Trust In God” we ask all others to bring data to prove their treatment works before we offer it to you. Voodoo medicine, we leave that up to others.</p>
<p>Remember that you are human and no one modality is going to successfully treat your pain. When others try, they are practicing malpractice and you are the only one who is being taken advantage of and suffers. Don’t let it happen. Look up what we are saying.</p>
<p>Let us help and you will either end up eliminating your pain or become capable of controlling it instead of it controlling you.</p>
