                <p>“SELF DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR” is repeatedly doing something that you know hurts you. Got that? You know what you’re
                  doing hurts you. Why would you continue to do that? Your sense of self worth comes from your Spirit. Physical or Emotional Pain can beat down your Spirit and lead to Self Destructive Behavior.
                  The behavior is not the problem, it is an expression of underlying pain!</p>
                <p>We believe this is horrific and leaves those trapped only a few ways out: Hospitalization,
                  Incarceration, Destitution, or Death. We are experts. We are not just victims or survivors
                  of our own dysfunctions; we are SUCCESSES. Our program helped us and it can help you also. There are a
                  lot of so called "programs" out there but they just do not work. We all know this fact.</p>
                <p>Physical or Emotional Pain can lead to Self Destructive Behavior. The behavior is not the problem, it is an
                  expression of underlying pain!</p>

                  <strong>THE NEXT GOOD STEP</strong> aims to improve any life. We focus on the reason for
                  behavior. We believe that understanding and working through ones issues allows you to not only overcome but master your pain. 
                  </p>
                <p>The Next Good Step is what all of us should be pursuing daily. Everyone has issues but if we do not
                  take the time to work through them then they will find a way to be expressed. If your expression is
                  destructive behavior, please, before you are overcome by it, join us for just a few meetings as we
                  all grow, become, and take The Next Good Step together.</p>

                <h5>We live by the choices we make. “CHANGE”, begins with a promise to yourself to try</h5>
                <p>A change of life can only truly exist if underlying issues are identified. By addressing these
                  issues, often for the first time, we understand their triggers and find our bridge to a real
                  life.</p>
                <p>We provide you the tools to understand and deal with your pain and spirituality. This approach gives you control over
                  your destructive behavior instead of it controlling you. As you gain your self worth and come to understand “why” then your
                  self destruction fades away on its own. It is not a self discipline issue. Instead, as you become,
                  as you grow and understand yourself, the urges that drive your behavior to hurt yourself simply lessen and fade away
                  because they are no longer an expression of who you are.</p>
                <p>Our approach is so fundamental that all you need do is show up and you will “become”. We know our
                  program works so please stop ignoring the problem, join us, and together we will watch you grow and
                  become. It is simple and it works!</p>
                <p>Also, we are one of the few programs that offer controlled detox for those with physical dependance and pain issues. Implants are also available for long term treatment as needed. </p>
